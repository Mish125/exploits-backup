======================================================================

Recently I heard some interesting news about our team.

------------------------------------------

That’s how Milw0rm dead and inj3ct0r born..Who are the injectors? There are total four prime admins, and four key injectors running the show, 
after going through lots of legal mess now injectors are revamping their plans. JF who is CEO of this group, holds big team of black hat hackers, 
the other key holder injectors are form India and Pakistan. Milworms all published exploits were posted on injector, one of the amature injector, 
who is young and sill studying, has taken undue advantage of the situations that who the Injector came in existance, R00ter a pakistan based 
injector is one of the most brillient and strongest admin of this group,Microsoft is the biggest sponsor and one of the financial supports for this group…

-------------------------------------------

It spread with great rapidity. I will comment:


>> JF who is CEO of this group

That's not true! At this point the owner is r0073r. JF is one of the top administration of the project.

>> R00ter a pakistan 

no.. r0073r is not pakistan project. As far as I know, in our team there is not a Pakistani h4x0rs.

>> Microsoft is the biggest sponsor and one of the financial supports for this group…

LOL!!!11 has nothing to do with us. Do not believe it. All the data about us can be found on our website or write to me personally to email mr.r0073r@gmail.com or mr.inj3ct0r@gmail.com

Our project is funded entirely by team members. But if Microsoft has decided to donate a million dollars, we would not refuse ;)
