there was no reply 2 weeks. We wrote every day. Came the answer:

Hello, 

The above domain names were suspended as they were involved in all kind of exploit activities. Just Google the word Inj3ct0r and you will get the reason why we suspended these domain names.

The Inj3ct0r team is responsible for high profile hacking cases like Facebook which grabbed headlines. Keeping these domain names unsuspended is a big risk to take. The abusive activities carried out by these domains can lead to legal and criminal investigations, which are best avoided in both our and your interest. 

Regards, 
Ivan. 

---------------------------------------

Then we register http://www.xlserver.org/ They have blocked our domain in exactly 21 hours after registration

we did not lose hope. We registered our new domain name at https://www.networksolutions.com We paid for a domain for 5 years. They blocked early in 2 days.

We ordered domain http://dd24.net/ and they did not register it, and the money not returned.
