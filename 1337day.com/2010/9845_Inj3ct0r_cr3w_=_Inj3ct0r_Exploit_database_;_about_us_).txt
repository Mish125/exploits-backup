Inj3ct0r.com - The Underground, is one of the world's most popular and comprehensive computer security web sites.

Inj3ct0r.com was originally founded in 2003, by a hacker computer enthusiast.
Initially, Inj3ct0r was a private team. Domain Inj3ct0r.com was registered in 2008. 
The enormous database, the constant updates, the unique nature of the content published.

Our site is visited by home and enterprise users, universities, government and military institutions on a daily basis.

Inj3ct0r offers a resource of up-to-date exploits and advisories found by Inj3ct0r security research team.
We are comprised of security professionals that are dedicated to provide necessary information to secure
application software. We accomplish this goal by publishing new security advisories on the internet. 
Inj3ct0r staff is made up of a group of highly skilled professionals, all directly engaged in the technical 
computer and software security arenas.

Inj3ct0r provides useful information to people who perform penetration testing, IDS signature development, 
and exploit research. This project was created to provide information on exploit techniques and to create a useful 
resource for exploit developers and security professionals. The tools and information on this site are provided for 
legal security research and testing purposes only. 

For the first time the idea of creating a project Inj3ct0r appeared on 13 May 2003
Inj3ct0r project - Network Security
Activities: coding, security, web security analyze

The project is devoted to computer security, protection and hacking of computer networks, software and information.

Later the group did create Inj3ct0r site, which is a regularly updated database with descriptions of the vulnerabilities
and exploit the various software products. The base is divided into sections by type of exploit: local, remote, DoS, etc.
Also presented to the division on the platform: BSD, Linux, QNX, OSX, Solaris, Unix, Windows and so on.

Latest exploits are designed to exploit newly discovered critical vulnerabilities.
This project is designed to receive, deposit and exchange of information between the parties, which are thematically linked to
computer activities. One of the priorities is the creation of a unified knowledge base for people interested in the subject,
one way or another connected with the computer: be it software or programming languages, network protocols, or security
network resources and hardware - all this we seek to explain the project.

The project does not belong to the Turkish, American, Russian, Chinese, Ukrainian ,.. etc...  hackers! 
We have gathered experts from different countries. Our goal is to gather the best experts, we are not interested in your country, 
religious views ... We are interested in your knowledge. The objective - build a single and the biggest exploits base.

Inj3ct0r contains information which could be considered illegal in some countries. It is provided here for educational use 
only and is not intended to be used for illegal activities. We provide the information to you "as is" and will not be held 
responsible for any damage done to your own 
personal or alien machine, exploit the archive is intended only for use in educational purposes.

Tnx all! //r0073r
